# Discrete Fourier Transform

This is a simulation of the discrete Fourier transform to estimate the outline of an SVG images using harmonic functions in polar coordinates!

Simply run
```
py main.py
```

The script will draw the image pi.svg using the pi.json file. This is done by creating harmonic functions that best fit the points. 

The more harmonic functions that are used the more accurate the drawing. This is similar to a Taylor series expansion.
